# Cycle (Sprint) Observations

**Purpose**: Consolidate learnings from each agile cycle so that at the end of the cycle we can review and update the framework appropriately.

## Folder Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | This index; explains cycle documentation. |
| `cycle-4-feb-2026.md` | Cycle 4 observations (ending Feb 15, 2026). DAEE-100 GSTR-1 automation completed. |
| `cycle-5-feb-2026.md` | Cycle 5 placeholder (starts Feb 16, 2026). |

## Cycle Naming

- **Format**: `cycle-{N}-{month}-{year}.md`
- **Dates**: Document cycle end date in the file; next cycle starts the following day.

## What to Capture Each Cycle

1. **Scope**: Major work (e.g. DAEE-100 completion, new module).
2. **Gaps**: Missing documentation, missing TEST_CASE_REGISTRY/test-impact-matrix entries, missing gap-analysis/implementation-history.
3. **Bad practices**: Anti-patterns that crept in (e.g. CSS class selectors, `waitForTimeout`, duplicated steps).
4. **Learnings**: What worked well; what to do differently.
5. **Framework update recommendations**: Changes to persona rules, QUICK_START, or framework docs for the next cycle.

## End-of-Cycle Review

- Update framework docs (persona, QUICK_START, LOCATOR_STRATEGY) based on cycle observations.
- Backlog: Add tasks for TEST_CASE_REGISTRY, test-impact-matrix, and locator clean-up if needed.
- Link cycle doc from relevant Linear/epic (e.g. DAEE-100).
